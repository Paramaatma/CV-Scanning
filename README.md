# CV-Scanning

Business Understanding:
The goal of this project is to automate the process of screening resumes for job vacancies in a company. The traditional approach of manual screening of resumes is time-consuming and may result in biases. By using machine learning models, the process can be automated, leading to a more efficient and objective screening process.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of resumes of job applicants for different positions in the company. The data includes information such as education, work experience, skills, and other relevant details.

Data Preprocessing:
The data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant information, such as personal information and images, and to extract relevant features, such as education, work experience, and skills. The text data is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters, and then transformed into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words or word embeddings.

Data Analysis:
The data is analyzed using various machine learning techniques to identify patterns and extract insights. Supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, Naive bayes and random forests are used to classify resumes into different categories, such as qualified and unqualified, based on the job requirements. Unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering and anomaly detection can also be used to identify unusual or outstanding resumes.

Model Building:
Machine learning models are built to predict the category of each resume based on the job requirements. The models are trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using a validation set. The best performing model is then selected and tested on a holdout set to ensure its generalization capability.

Results:
The results of the analysis are presented in a clear and concise manner, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The models are tested on new resumes to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting the category of each resume. The insights are used to improve the screening process and to ensure that the selected candidates meet the job requirements.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models for automating the process of resume screening. By using the right features and algorithms, the models can accurately classify resumes into different categories, leading to a more efficient and objective screening process.

ML Deployment:
Deployed ML model using pkl and vectorizer model
